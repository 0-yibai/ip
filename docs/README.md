## Undo the last action

You can undo the last storage-changing action. Non-storage-changing
actions are simply ignored. Our app will trace back to find the most
recent storage-changing action.

The following commands are considered storage-changing actions:
`todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `mark`, `unmark`, `delete`.

Note that `undo` itself is not considered a storage-changing action.

Example: `undo`

```
     Undo unmark successful.
```
